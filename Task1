Task 1: write a program that prints your name, department and favourite quote using escape sequences to align and decorate output

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{

    cout << "Name:\t\tSidra Bashir\n";
    cout << "Department:\tSCIT\n";
    cout << "Favourite Quote:\n";
    cout << "\t\"The future belongs to those who believe\n";
    cout << "\t in the beauty of their dreams.\"\n";

    return 0;
}



Task 2:Write a program that calculates the average rainfall for three months. The program 
should ask the user to enter the name of each month, such as June or July, and the 
amount of rain (in inches) that fell each month. 


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    string month1, month2, month3;
    float rain1, rain2, rain3;

    cout << "Enter name of first month: ";
    cin >> month1;
    cout << "Enter rainfall (in inches) for " << month1 << ": ";
    cin >> rain1;

    cout << "\nEnter name of second month: ";
    cin >> month2;
    cout << "Enter rainfall (in inches) for " << month2 << ": ";
    cin >> rain2;

    cout << "\nEnter name of third month: ";
    cin >> month3;
    cout << "Enter rainfall (in inches) for " << month3 << ": ";
    cin >> rain3;

    float average = (rain1 + rain2 + rain3) / 3.0;

    cout << "\nThe average rainfall for " << month1 << ", "
         << month2 << ", and " << month3
         << " is " << average << " inches.\n";

    return 0;
}


Task 3: The surface area A of a cylinder is given by the following formula: 
A  = 2 πrh + 2 πr2 
The volume V of a cylinder is given by the following formula: 
V = πr2h 
The term r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder. Write a program that asks 
the user for the radius and height of the cylinder and displays the area and volume. 
Assume that value of π is 3.1415926535. 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    const float PI = 3.1415926535f;
    float radius, height;
    float area, volume;

    cout << "Enter the radius of the cylinder: ";
    cin >> radius;

    cout << "Enter the height of the cylinder: ";
    cin >> height;

    area = 2 * PI * radius * height + 2 * PI * radius * radius;
    volume = PI * radius * radius * height;

    cout << "\nArea of the cylinder = " << area << endl;
    cout << "Volume of the cylinder = " << volume << endl;

    return 0;
}


Task 4: A company is hiring new recruits who should be within 18 to 28 years of age. Write a 
program that asks the user to input the current year and an applicant’s year of birth. 
It then displays the age and a message indicating whether the applicant is eligible.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    int currentYear, birthYear, age;

    cout << "Enter the current year: ";
    cin >> currentYear;

    cout << "Enter the year of birth: ";
    cin >> birthYear;

    age = currentYear - birthYear;

    cout << "\nApplicant's age: " << age << " years" << endl;

    if (age >= 18 && age <= 28)
        cout << "Status: Eligible." << endl;
    else
        cout << "Status: Not eligible." << endl;

    return 0;
}


Task 5: Write a program that asks the user to enter the length and width of two rectangles. 
The program should calculate the area of each rectangle using the formula: 
A𝑟𝑒𝑎 = 𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ × 𝑊𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ
 After calculating both areas, the program should: 
● Display the area of each rectangle, 
● Indicate whether Rectangle 1 and Rectangle 2 have equal areas or not.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    float length1, width1, length2, width2;
    float area1, area2;

    cout << "Enter the length of Rectangle 1: ";
    cin >> length1;
    cout << "Enter the width of Rectangle 1: ";
    cin >> width1;

    cout << "\nEnter the length of Rectangle 2: ";
    cin >> length2;
    cout << "Enter the width of Rectangle 2: ";
    cin >> width2;

    area1 = length1 * width1;
    area2 = length2 * width2;

    cout << "\nArea of Rectangle 1 = " << area1 << endl;
    cout << "Area of Rectangle 2 = " << area2 << endl;

    if (area1 == area2)
        cout << "\nBoth rectangles have equal areas." << endl;
    else
        cout << "\nThe rectangles do not have equal areas." << endl;

    return 0;
}
